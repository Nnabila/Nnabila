# License Justification

I chose the **MIT License** for this repository (**Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection Using Machine Learning Approach**) because it’s a widely used, permissive license that maximizes reuse and collaboration with minimal friction. MIT allows anyone to use, modify, and redistribute the code—including in commercial and closed-source contexts—as long as the copyright notice and warranty disclaimer are preserved. This fits my goal for a class/open-source project where others can easily learn from and adapt the code.

I considered **GPLv3/AGPLv3** (strong copyleft), which require modified versions to remain open on redistribution (AGPL also covers network use), and **Apache-2.0**, which is permissive but adds an explicit patent license. Since this project doesn’t introduce patentable techniques and I want the simplest path to adoption, **MIT** provides clear permissions with minimal overhead.
